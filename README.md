## Phase 4: Task 3

If I were to refactor my application, I would reduce coupling by breaking up Menu, and find more code to abstract. I would find more duplicate code to resolve/simplify, and refactor my classes to have less dependency on each other. Finally, I would find things to optimize in runtime and memory allocation, and refactor my UI for increased aesthetic, usability and accesibility.
